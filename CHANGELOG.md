# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial repository scaffolding: single-package TypeScript/Vite/SolidJS
  project, Biome, Vitest, `dependency-cruiser` layering checks, CI workflow.
- `src/protocol/address.ts`: `PresetSlot` and `MultiSlot` memory addressing
  with region constants for preset/configuration/volatile memory.
- `src/protocol/cc.ts`: MIDI CC number constants for every parameter in the
  spec's CC table, and a shared `decodeZoned` helper for the zoned/breakpoint
  CC enums.

### Fixed

- Pinned TypeScript to `^6` — `dependency-cruiser` doesn't parse TS 7's
  (Go-ported compiler) output yet and silently cruises 0 modules against it.
  Revisit once dependency-cruiser publishes TS7 support.

### Documentation

- Architecture and protocol-quirks docs, reference document download
  instructions.
